# The skinny

### Installation

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("hughjonesd/refset")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(results='markup', echo=TRUE)
knitr_options(opts_chunk=list(echo=TRUE, results='markup'))
```

### Creating a refset

```{r}
library(refset)
employees <- data.frame(
      id=1:4, 
      name=c("James", "Sylvia", "Meng Qi", "Luis"), 
      age=c(28,44,38, 23), 
      gender=factor(c("M", "F", "F", "M")), 
      stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
      
refset(rs, employees[1:2,])
```

### Refsets refer to the original

```{r}
rs
employees$name[1] <- "Jimmy"
rs
```

### Refsets change the original
```{r}
rs$age <- c(29, 45)
employees$age
```

### Assigning to a new variable breaks the link
```{r}
ss <- rs
employees$name[2] <- "Silvia"
rs$name[2]
ss$name[2]
```

### You can have refsets of refsets
```{r}
refset(rs2, rs$id)
rs2 
rs$id <- rs$id + 1000
rs2
rs2 <- 101:102
employees$id
```

### Refset size can change dynamically
```{r}
# the multi-argument form. Note the empty argument, to select all columns:
refset(rsd, employees, age < 30, , drop=FALSE)
rsd
employees$age <- employees$age + 1
rsd
```

### You can refset any subsettable object...
```{r}
vec <- 1:10
refset(rs, vec, 4:6)
rs <- rs*10
vec
```

### ... using any form of subsetting
```{r}
lst <- list(a="text", b=42, NA)
refset(rsl, lst$b)
rsl <- "more text"
lst$b
```

### The short form
```{r}
rs %r% employees[1:3,] # equivalent to refset(rs, employees[1:2,])
```

### To pass a refset into a function, wrap it 
```{r wrap}
f <- function(x) {
  cx <- contents(x)
  contents(x)$name <- paste(cx$name, "the", sample(c("Kid", "Terrible", "Silent", 
        "Fair"), nrow(cx), replace=TRUE))
}

parcel <- wrap(rs)
f(parcel)
employees

```

## Introduction

Normally, R uses "pass by value". This means that when you run
`b <- a` you have two independent copies of the same data. Similarly, the code:

```{r}
f <- function(x) {x <- x*2}
a <- 4
f(a)
a
```
does not change the value of `a`, since the function `f` gets passed the contents
of `a` rather than the variable `a` itself.

This is fine for most cases, especially for traditional uses of R in which
the programmer or statistician passes in a value to a function, and sees
the result on the command line. However, in some cases we would like to work with
a single object, rather than multiple copies. For example:

* working on a complex dataset, an analyst may wish to work with part of the dataset, but to have any changes reflected in the whole data frame.
* if a data frame represents objects in a relational database, changes to the database on disk should be reflected in the data frame.
* for large datasets, assigning into multiple copies can take up memory.

The refset package allows you to do this, by creating objects that refer to other
objects, or subsets of them.

To create a refset, call refset with two arguments:

```{r}
dfr <- data.frame(x1=1:5, x2=rnorm(5), alpha=letters[1:5])
refset(rs, dfr[dfr$x1 <= 3, c("x1", "alpha")])
```

The call above creates a new variable `rs` in your environment. (Strictly, it
creates a new _binding_, but we needn't worry about that for now.) For 
comparison, we'll also create a standard subset.

```{r}
ss <- dfr[dfr$x1 <= 3, c("x1", "alpha")]
ls()
rs
ss
```

`rs` and `ss` look and behave just the same:

```{r}
c(class(rs), class(ss))
c(mean(rs$x1), mean(ss$x1))
```

To see the difference, let's change the data in `dfr`:

```{r}
dfr$alpha <- c(NA, letters[23:26])
rs
ss
```

As is normal, `ss` has not updated to reflect changes in the original data frame.
But `rs` has. 

The connection also works the other way, if you change `rs`.

```{r}
rs$alpha <- LETTERS[1:3]
rs
dfr
```

Everything that you do to `rs` will be reflected in the original data, and
vice versa. Well, almost everything: remember that `rs` refers to a _subset_ of
the data. If you can't do it to a subset, you probably can't do it to a refset. 
For example, changing the `names` of a refset doesn't work, because assigning to
the names of a subset of your data doesn't change the original names.

## Ways to call refset

There are three ways to create a refset. The first you have already seen:
call `refset(name, data[indices])` where `name` is the variable name of the variable you want to create, and `data[indices]` is the subset you want to look
at. You aren't limited to using data frames. You can refset any 
object which you can subset, and you can use any of the
three standard ways to subset data: `$`, `[[` and `[`.

```{r}
vec <- 1:10
refset(rvec, vec[2:3])
mylist <- list(a="some", b="more", c="data")
refset(rls, mylist$b)
refset(rls2, mylist[["c"]])
rvec
c(rls, rls2)
```

However, this won't work:

```{r, error=TRUE}
myss <- subset(dfr, x1>1)
refset(rs, myss)
```

You have to specifically write out the subset you want: you can't put it in
a variable.

The second way to call `refset` is using the `%r%` infix operator. This is
conveniently short, and also makes it clearer that you are assigning to a 
variable.

```{r}
top4 %r% dfr[1:4,]
exists("top4")
```

The last way to create a refset is the 3-or-more argument form of the function.
This works like the `subset` command in R base: you can refer to data frame
columns by name directly.

```{r}
refset(large, dfr, x2 > 0,)
large
```

Notice that we've included an empty argument. This is just the same as when you 
call `dfr[dfr$x2 > 0, ]` with an empty argument after the comma: it includes
all the columns.

## Dynamic indexing

Refsets don't just sync their data with their "parent". They also update
their indices dynamically. For example, suppose we have a database of employees,
including hours worked in the past month.

```{r}
employees <- data.frame(
      id=1:4, 
      name=c("James", "Sylvia", "Meng Qi", "Luis"), 
      age=c(28,44,38, 23), 
      gender=factor(c("M", "F", "F", "M")),
      hours=c(160, 130, 185, 145),
      pay=c(60000, 50000, 70000, 60000),
      stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
```

We can create a refset of employees who worked overtime:

```{r}
overtimers %r% employees[employees$hours > 140,]
overtimers
```

When the new monthly data comes in, the set of people in `overtimers` will change:

```{r}
employees$hours <- c(135, 150, 70, 145)
overtimers
```

Sometimes you may wish to turn this behaviour off. For example, you may want
to look at a particular subset that had a certain characteristic at a point in
time. For this, use the argument `dyn.idx=FALSE` to `refset`.

```{r}
# people who worked long hours last month:
refset(overtimers_static, employees, hours > 140, , dyn.idx=FALSE)
# give them a holiday...
overtimers_static$hours <- 0
# ... and a pay rise
overtimers_static$pay <- overtimers_static$pay * 1.1 
overtimers_static
```
Without the `dyn.idx=FALSE` argument, the refset would have zero rows after the
call setting `hours` to 0.

## Delinking from the parent, and using parcels

If you want to break the link to the parent dataset, simply assign your refset
to a new variable. 

```{r}
copy <- overtimers
copy$pay <- copy$pay * 2
employees$pay # still the same :/
```

Refsets are implemented using an R feature called "active binding", which
calls a function when you access or change a variable. Reassigning to a new
variable reassigns the contents, rather than the binding. 

This causes a problem if you want to pass a reference into functions, rather 
than passing the value of the refset -- for example, if you would like
to change the refset in the body of the function, and have this affect the
original data. When you use a refset in a function argument, it binds it to 
a new value, breaking the link with the parent.

If you are writing your own code, you can avoid this problem by `wrap`ping your
refset into a "parcel" object. Parcels simply contain an expression and an
environment in which the expression should be evaluated. For example, they can
contain the name of a refset. When the `contents` function is called on a parcel,
the expression is reevaluated. Here's how to write a function that changes the
name of our employees:


```{r}
rs %r% employees[1:3,]
```

```{r, ref.label='wrap'}
```

As the above shows, you can assign to `contents(parcel)` as well as read from it.
You can also create a new variable from the parcel by using `unwrap_as`. Another
way to write the function above would be:

```{r}
f <- function(parcel) {
  unwrap_as(emps, parcel)
  emps$name <- paste(emps$name, "the", sample(c("Kid", "Terrible", "Silent", 
        "Fair"), nrow(emps), replace=TRUE))
}
f(parcel)
employees
```

There is a shorthand function to create a wrapped refset, called (unsurprisingly)
wrapset.

```{r}
parcel <- wrapset(employees, grepl("Terrible", employees$name), )
contents(parcel)
```

Using parcels is a way to pass references around code. You could also do this
using non-standard evaluation ([NSE][nse]). Parcels have the nice feature that
they store the environment where they should be evaluated.
